// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
let firstName = 'Terry';
console.log(firstName);
// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
let lastName = 'O\'Keefe';
console.log(lastName);
// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`
console.log( fullName );
// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.
let luckyNumber = 22;
console.log('my lucky number:', luckyNumber);
// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above:
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.
console.log( 'My name is ' + fullName + ', and I think ' + luckyNumber + ' is a winner!');
// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)
let adventurous = true;
console.log(adventurous);
// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food
let food = 'pizza';
console.log(food);
// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have
let pets = 0;
console.log('my pets:',pets);
// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has
let friendsPets = 1;
console.log('friends pets:',friendsPets);
// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable
pets += 2;
console.log('my pets:', pets);
// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
const allowedPets = 3;
console.log('allowed pets:', allowedPets);
// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!",
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
if ( adventurous ) {
  console.log( 'Adventures are great!');
} // end if adventurous is true
else {
  console.log( 'How about we stay home?' );
} // end if is not adventurous
// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
if (luckyNumber === 2 && adventurous) {
  console.log( 'Roll the dice!' );
} // code if both are true
else {
  console.log( 'No dice for you!' ); // code to run if false
} // code if one or the other is false
// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!"
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.
if ( pets < allowedPets ) {
  console.log( 'I can have more pets!' );
} // block of code to be executed if pets is less than allowedPets
else if (pets === allowedPets) {
  console.log( 'I have enough pets' );
} // block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else {
  console.log( 'Oh no, I have too many pets!');
} // block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false

// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios.
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.
let mostPets;

if (pets > friendsPets) {
  mostPets = pets;
}

if (pets < friendsPets) {
  mostPets = friendsPets
}

console.log('most pets:',mostPets);

// 17 - Rewrite question 16 with a `switch` statement. You'll need to do research!

switch (mostPets) {
  case pets:
    console.log('I have the most pets');
    break; // run if I have more pets
  case friendsPets:
    console.log('My friend has more Pets');
    break; // run if my friend has the most pets
  default:
    console.log('Does anyone have pets?'); // if none of the above cases executed
}

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!

let myAdventure = adventurous ? 'Adventures are great!' : 'How about we stay home?';

console.log(myAdventure);
